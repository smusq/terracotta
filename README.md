# <center>Terracotta</center>
<center>Minecraft Bedrock Behavior Pack for correcting incorrect player actions.</center>

## Philosophy and Motive
Terracotta was created with a single vision: to maintain the authenticity of the Minecraft experience while protecting it from exploits and cheats. Traditional anti-cheat solutions often compromise the player's immersion by aggressively banning or punishing suspected cheaters, which can lead to false positives and a disrupted gameplay experience. Instead, Terracotta takes a different approach, focusing on correction over punishment. By automatically adjusting exploitative behaviors rather than flagging or kicking players, it ensures that everyone in the game can enjoy a smooth, fair, and engaging environment, free from interruptions or accusations.

Terracotta operates seamlessly in the background, with players often unaware that it’s even there. This subtle design prevents distractions, allowing players to focus on the game itself rather than on the software maintaining its integrity. By correcting behavior invisibly, Terracotta preserves the sense of freedom and exploration that defines Minecraft, while subtly reinforcing fair play.

Furthermore, as an open-source project, Terracotta is a community-driven effort. Its transparent codebase invites contributions from developers and players alike, encouraging the community to improve, customize, and adapt it to their specific needs. This approach not only empowers server admins with full control over the anti-cheat system but also aligns with Minecraft’s spirit of creativity and collaboration.

In essence, Terracotta is more than just an anti-cheat; it's a commitment to preserving Minecraft’s core values. It allows players to play without restriction, without fear of accidental punishment, and without intrusions, while offering server admins a powerful tool that upholds a fair playing field. By choosing correction over confrontation, Terracotta ensures that Minecraft remains as immersive, inclusive, and enjoyable as it was meant to be.
